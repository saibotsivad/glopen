## Pull Requests

Please consider these simple guidelines when filing a pull request:

* Commits follow the [Angular commit convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
* [Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment](https://gist.github.com/saibotsivad/06021a81865226cfc140)
* Features and bug fixes should *ideally* be covered by test cases, but if you need help with these then ask!

## Security

For security issues, please first email tobias@davistobias.com instead of filing an issue.

Github issues are a hot mess, and I'm not always great about responding to email, so feel free to ping me on Twitter [@saibotsivad](https://twitter.com/saibotsivad) and let me know you sent an email if I don't respond very quickly.
