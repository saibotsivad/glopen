# User Management

Routes for the management of other users.

> **Note:** these routes make use of the [single-user `user` model](../single-user/openapi/components/schemas/user.@.js). This assumes that you will also be using those routes as well. If not, you'll need to do your own manual juggling to import only the `user` model.
